In academia and political debates, the notions of 'degrowth' has gained traction sinv=ce the dawn of the 21st century. While some uncertainity around its exact definition remains, research on degrowth revolved around the idea of reducing resource and energy throughput as a unifying theme. We copy a mixed-methods design to systematically review the scientific aspects. English literature from 2008 to 2022 that refers to ' degrowth' or 'post-growth', words or abstract (N = 951). We find a lack of concrete distributional and monitory proposals in the sample analyzed, and a low overall degree of collaboration among authors in relation to degrowth's age and size.
